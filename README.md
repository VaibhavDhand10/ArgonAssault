# Argon Assault – 3D Rail Shooter Game 🎮

This is a 3D on-rails shooter game made using Unity as part of the [GameDev.tv Unity 3D course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/learn/lecture/46455549?start=15#overview). The project focuses on animation-driven gameplay and hands-on implementation of core Unity systems like prefabs, audio, and enemy wave logic.

## 🚀 Features

- ✈️ **Clamped Player Movement**: The player ship moves along a set axis while the animation drives the camera and world around it.
- 🌍 **Custom Terrain**: Built using Unity’s terrain tools for a unique planetary feel.
- 👾 **Animated Enemy Waves**: Enemies spawn in animated waves using the Animation Window, with multiple prefab types requiring different hit counts (layered health).
- 🎯 **Combat System**: Shoot enemies with bullet-based damage logic tied to their prefab setup.
- 💬 **Dialogue System**: Basic dialogue implemented through the animation system.
- 🎵 **Audio Integration**: Background music loops seamlessly for immersive experience.
